A: By default 3 at a time, regardless of mixture of upload and download (tested w/ S3)

Q: What happens if the server goes away halfway through a transfer?
E: I started 2 up/2 down and then killed the server halfway through
A: the downloads failed immediately.  The uploads didn't - I waited less than an minute then started the server again and the uploads resumed.  The app was in the foreground the whole time.  If you wait long enough the uplaods fail also.  The upload timeout seems to be about a minute. 

Q: what happens if the server isn't there when you retry?
